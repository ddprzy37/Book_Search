### Built With

* React - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications. Its component-based architecture allows for efficient reusability and maintainability of code, making it ideal for building interactive and complex user interfaces. React's virtual DOM ensures fast updates and rendering, providing a smooth user experience even with large-scale applications.

* Node.js - A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, enabling the development of scalable and high-performance backend services.

* Express.js - A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. Express is essential for handling routing, middleware, and server-side logic.

* MongoDB - A NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it a natural fit for applications that deal with large volumes of unstructured data. It's highly performant and offers rich query capabilities.

* Apollo Server - A GraphQL server that enables you to build a self-documenting, secure API with advanced features like subscriptions, caching, and schema stitching. Apollo Server integrates seamlessly with Node.js and Express.js to handle GraphQL queries and mutations.

* GraphQL - A query language for your API that allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving the efficiency of data retrieval. GraphQL provides a more flexible and powerful alternative to traditional RESTful APIs.

* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWT is used for securely transmitting information as a JSON object, commonly used for authentication and authorization.

* Bootstrap - A popular CSS framework that helps create responsive and visually appealing web interfaces. Bootstrap provides pre-designed components and utilities that streamline the development process, ensuring consistency and accessibility across devices.

* Vite - A fast and optimized build tool that serves modern JavaScript applications. Vite offers instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized builds for production, making it a preferred choice for modern frontend development.
